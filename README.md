# WINE QUALITY ANALYSIS

The main goal of this project is to perform exploratory statistical analysis on a dataset containing wine chemical parameters and quality evaluation.
Our group will attempt to correlate the chemical parameters with each other and with the quality assesment to create a model that predicts the quality
given the chemical-physical data

## Step 1: What questions do we want to awnser?
Are the variables correlated?
Is it possible to predict wine quality given the sensory data?
Are there subclasses of wines inside the dataset?
